# QR Code Generator Algorithms

### Overview  
A Python-based suite of algorithms for generating secure and customised QR codes with enhanced features such as dynamic content updates, visual watermarks, and anti-copy steganographic elements. Designed for industrial applications including packaging, inventory management, and product authenticity verification.

### ðŸ’» Software  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Development Environment**: Anaconda / Spyder  
- **Tested On**: Python 3.10+  
- **Execution Platform**: Desktop environments (Windows/Linux/macOS)

### ðŸ“¦ Key Features  
- Static & dynamic QR code generation  
- Visual watermark and embedded ID printing  
- Optional steganographic encoding for secure data  
- Image overlay and readability optimisation  
- Excel integration for batch processing

### Impact  
> Industrial freelance project involving secure QR codes for pharmaceuticals and fashion packaging  
> Emphasis on real-world deployability and readability under scanner-specific constraints
